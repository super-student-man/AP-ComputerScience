# AP-ComputerScience
The entire course content of AP ComputerScience and Learning Java.
# Getting Started (Windows and MacOS)
**step 1** Download and install Java, this is very important, you need to have Java installed in order to use Java you can download Java [here](https://www.java.com/en/) and setup instructions are below.<br>
**step 2** Double click the installer once it's downloaded. So the Java installer should setup your path variable on windows, if it has not you will have to do additional work, adding Java to your path. On MacOS if the installer hasn't setup your path variable you will have to go to your terminal and manually add Java to your PATH variable. `export PATH=LOCATION_OF_JAVA:"$PATH"` if you are having problems follow [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_environment_setup.htm) Java setup tutorial.<br>
**step 3**In order to learn Java for AP ComputerScience you're going to need an IDE such as netbeans, intellij, or eclipse in order to write Java code. Below are a few popular IDEs. An IDE is an enviornment that is similar to a text editor but will allow us to execute code.<br>
- [Intellij Idea](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
- [Net Beans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html)
