# Primitive Types
**1.1** Why programming? Why Java?
This is the first part of the first unity of AP Computer Science and it's a good idea to understand
why you are learning to program and why Java of all the languages. So the answer to why
programming is, because programming helps is an important first step into the study of computation.
Understanding a new model of thinking in the form of programming is helpful and rather significant
for anyone looking to survive in the modern world. Why Java? Because, Sun Microsystems spent $300 million
marketing Java making Java the most used programming language in the world for a brief period about a decade ago.

## 1.2 Variables and Data Types
A variable like in math is some placeholder that does or will represent something. Data Types in Java include
are the types of data that we're representing for example a number `int x = 14;` must be declared as
an integer. If it's a decimal we may use `float` or `double` there are other Data Types such as `long` 
`short` and `byte` but those are rarely if ever used.

## 1.3 Expressions and Assignment Statements
So we've already seen an assignment statement in the form of `int x = 14;` we're just assigning the variable 
`x` of type `int` to value `14`. An expression in Java similar to a math expression can be written as if you
were putting it into a calculator. `x = x + 3;` although in Java this could be compressed to `x += 3;`

## 1.4 Compound Assignment Operators
Previously the example was `x += 3;` but in this situation this operator is doing two things rather than just one
some other compound assignments may be `x++;` or `x--;` as well as `x -= 3;`

## 1.5 Type Casting
An int may be cast to a double like `int x = 14;` then `double y = (double) x;` types that you can cast
`char -> String` `int -> double` `float -> double` etc.
